  This repository is a data engineering and analysis project using employee data from a 1980s-1990s (fictional) tech company. The first part is a data engineering project creating a table schema for each of the csv files located in the data folder of this repository. The second part is a brief analysis querying key features of the data such as employee name, hiring dates, employee numbers etc.
  To run this module create a new database in pgadmin4 and copy  and run the TechEmployees-schema.sql code into the query tool to create tables for the project. Then import the csv files from the data folder into the tables in this order: (titles, employees, departments, dept_manager, dept_emp, salaries). From there you can run the queries by copying the TechEmployees-queries.sql into the query tool.
